📊 analysing_factor_of-student_performance:- Under IBMSkillbuilds Internship
📝 Overview
This project aims to analyze key factors influencing student academic performance, focusing on various aspects such as extracurricular activities, educational status, parental support, region, and culture. By leveraging data from Kaggle, we developed predictive models and generated actionable insights. These insights can help guide targeted interventions and policy recommendations to enhance educational outcomes and promote equity in education, aligning with Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4): Quality Education.

🎯 Objectives
🔍 Identify Key Factors: Determine the significant determinants of student academic performance.
🔢 Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering.
🔮 Predictive Modeling: Develop and evaluate models using Linear Regression and Random Forest.
📈 Intervention Strategies: Propose strategies based on analysis results.
📜 Policy Recommendations: Suggest policies to improve educational outcomes.
📊 Visualization: Use visualizations to effectively communicate findings.
📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle, containing information on 2391 high school students, including demographics, study habits, parental involvement, extracurricular activities, and academic performance.

📑 Data Description
🆔 StudentID: Unique identifier for each student.
👥 Demographics: Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Parental Education.
📚 Study Habits: Weekly study time, absences, tutoring status.
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Parental Involvement: Level of parental support.
🏆 Extracurricular Activities: Participation in sports, music, and volunteering.
🎓 Academic Performance: GPA, Grade classification.
🔧 Methodology
🧹 Data Cleaning
🔍 Handling Missing Values: Imputation with mean, median, or mode.
📏 Outlier Detection and Treatment: Using box plots and z-scores.
🏷️ Categorical Encoding: One-hot encoding and label encoding.
⚖️ Normalization/Standardization: Applied to numerical variables.
🔨 Feature Engineering
Analyzed correlations to select relevant features for modeling.
🤖 Predictive Modeling
🔗 Linear Regression: To understand relationships between predictors and GPA.
🌳 Random Forest: To capture non-linear relationships and improve prediction accuracy.
📏 Evaluation Metrics
✅ Accuracy: Overall model correctness.
🎯 Precision, Recall, F1-Score: For assessing model performance across different classes.
🔑 Key Findings
📊 GPA Distribution: Average GPA is 2.01 with a wide range.
⏱️ Impact of Study Time: Positive correlation with GPA.
👨‍🏫 Parental Education: Slight increase in GPA with higher parental education levels.
🚫 Absences: Strong negative correlation with GPA.
🎶🏅 Extracurricular Activities: Positive association with sports and music participation.
💡 Hypothesis
"Students who engage in extracurricular activities (sports, music, or volunteering) will have higher GPAs compared to those who do not participate in such activities."

🧪 Testing the Hypothesis
Statistical analysis using t-tests and multiple regression, controlling for other variables.
📊 Visualization
📊 Histograms, 📊 Boxplots, 🔄 KDE plots, 📊 Barplots, 🌡️ Heatmaps, 🔬 Scatter Plots, 🔗 Jointplots, 🌐 PairPlots.
🛠️ Tools and Software
Python Libraries: 🐍 scikit-learn, 📊 Matplotlib, 🌈 Seaborn, 📈 Plotly
Software: 📝 Jupyter Notebook
🚀 Future Work
Further studies including qualitative research, socioeconomic analysis, technology integration, mental health factors, peer influence study, and teacher quality assessment.
